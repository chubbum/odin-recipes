        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Growing up whenever we would go out to eat on the weekends, the Taiwanese and even some Chinese restaurants would always have this little smashed cucumber salad here as an appetizer.
            After moving away from my hometown in the San Gabriel valley I always find myself going back to my roots and trying to cook more Asian dishes at home.
            There are good Asian restaurants here where I am in San Francisco right now as well, but the valley had this abundance and variety of many niche childhood dishes.
            Just this past month, the only restaurant that I knew here that served stinky tofu just closed down, I find it sad because there are closures often these days especially from Asian restaurants.
            However I find solace from cooking these dishes and find myself as well keeping in touch with my culture.</p>
