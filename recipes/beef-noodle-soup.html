        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I personally am obsessed with noodle soups as I find it very comforting and warming for the heart.
            It is more so comforting in my Asian culture as we have noodle soups for when we are sick and who doesn't love slurping in these instances?
            This recipe is great if you don't have much time as this soup usually takes around 6 hours or so but this recipe makes it in under an hour!
            This savory noodle soup is also paired with fresh green onions and cilantro as a garnish which brings the whole dish together.</p>
