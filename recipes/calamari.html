        <H2>Description</H2>
        <p>I love fried foods, especially fried calamari in particular.
            In my own mind, one cannot go wrong with fried calamari since it can be paired with various sauces as well showing its duality.
            The recipe below isn't hard at all for beginners as it includes common pantry staples and the recipe itself features only 5 steps.</p>
